GDash
-----
An Emerald Mine-like game for GTK+.
Use the cursor keys and Ctrl to move.


util/any2gdash
--------------
You can use the any2gdash tool to convert caves found in snapshot files.
This tool extracts information, and creates a binary file,
which is similar to the internal format of an engine found in the snapshot.

Currently it loads BD1, BD2, PLCK, 1stB and CrLi snapshots.
Using these internal formats is important for now, as the GDash
engine is not completed yet. A later version can interpret some bytes
from the file, which some older one did not; yet it is not necessary to
import a game again for this.
Also these internal formats are subject to change, as I'm going on with
development, so converting all your games is somewhat discouraged for now.
In turn, conversions are very useful to test the engine and compatibility.
So treat the converted games as a way to test GDash and help me with
describing any problem you may find.
