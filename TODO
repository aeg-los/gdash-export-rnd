When opening the "cave settings" dialog while the editor window is rather small, it opens higher than the editor window, which can be off screen.
	the problem is in gtk+; bug reported. http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314084


TO DO
-----
Scheduling:
	*) I checked BD1 intermission timing. As said, it reduces the vertical size. To be exact, you can freely walk in lines 2 to 14. Walking to line 15 results in a permanent delay state, as you would get in line 22 on a normal cave. Same delays, but faster, since less lines are processed.
	*) different settings for clck, 1stb, bd2?

Also some ideas for sdash: What about the music theme at the title picture?

sounds:
	*) water sound, slime sound, ... defaultok
		lehet hogy magától meghatározza a ráta alapján?
	*) EZEKET MIND A MAKEFILEBA!
	
sdash bd1 intermissions scroll. maybe screen should be larger? or disable scrolling for these somehow?

option "More than 1 bomb" in the cave settings

I think the way you implemented the Maze and RandomFill is okay. I assume the engine will expect as many seed values as there are levels, right? This is a very important detail which has to be documented in the BDCFF specs. 

copy&paste objects?
