TO DO

As there is an Amoeba 2 now, I think it would be nice to be able to set a different color for that then Amoeba 1!

Either way, though, I think that the player should always be notified they're playing an intermission from the start (even if it means not using the opening status bar at all) It's not like you need to keep track of your lives during an intermission anyway.

bdcff beolvasás miért hash table?
  size és hasonló szarok miatt
  de tobb értéket is kéne tárolni
  "multimap"
dynstring beolvasást jobban beépíteni

Also, it doesn't correctly remember the path from where the file was loaded. It always goes back to /Gdash.
last used directory kicsit atgondolni

option to "fast scroll"
2x scroll for lcd
50hz scroll? (infrastrukturalis valtozasok)

sound:
	amoeba2
	creature change dir
	option to choose between C64 and Atari sound sets. 
	Sound themes would make sense

atari color names??

All drawing objects should wraparound, at least when lineshifted borders are activated.
deluxe caves 1 - wraparound miatt néhány cucc?

check plck caves

bottom border for plck caves	There is one key routine at 5dce in every PLCK based game, except for DLP1.55:
	.C:5dce   A9 07      LDA #$07
	.C:5dd0   A0 27      LDY #$27
	.C:5dd2   99 98 0B   STA $0B98,Y
	.C:5dd5   88         DEY
	.C:5dd6   10 FA      BPL $5DD2
	.C:5dd8   60         RTS

design tips?

surprise element

loading imported caves with the default struct?

apply the current cave timing settings to all the caves at once

Scheduling:	different settings for clck, 1stb?
	
sdash bd1 intermissions scroll. disable scrolling for these somehow?

extensive commenting

cow not perfect

record and playback of games

option "More than 1 bomb" in the cave settings

I think the way you implemented the Maze and RandomFill is okay. I assume the engine will expect as many seed values as there are levels, right?

copy&paste objects?
