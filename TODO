sdash bd1 intermissions scroll. disable scrolling for these somehow?
replay checksum
In GDash, the cave info bar at the bottom-left of the editor doesn't change when you press the next/previous cave buttons. Could you fix this?
In SDash, being able to change the color of the cave status bar to classic BD1/BD2 style would be neat.

Tweak the vertical scrolling a little the same as you did with the horizontal so Rockford doesn't catch the top of the screen. You can reach the top of the screen with even BD1 level 1 speeds.
An easier to read status bar for the top of Gdash.

c64 color status bar, if mostly c64 colors in cave
It would be very interesting if it would be possible to use an own title screen for each game. I do not know if this is possible but this would make it even more authentic.

TO DO

amikor bezárja az editor ablakot, akkor kéne egy replay checksum update?
vagy a delete event, és akkor rákérdez

TITLE SCREEN
	Animated intro screen would be nice. It's not necessary to see a complete game or so but animated walls, diamonds, butterflies, etc. would be nice. Same as in the original C64 games.
	Maybe animate the intro screen? It might be cool to have a little background cave where the elements move around. Or something.

STATUS BAR
	As for the status bar in GDash: Maybe a little bit larger font would do the thing. There is enough space to use a larger font.

Maybe game notes can be displayed under the title screen as soon as the game is loaded. Optionally at least if someone does not like to show it automatically. 

Maybe a button to apply certain settings to all caves. We'd have to think of which may be appropriate. Timing maybe. Or color palette type. Dunno about this one.

Already suggested I think: Atari sounds.

if (random(slime*4)<4) and (tab[x,y+2]=0) then
      Begin tab[x,y]:=0;col[x,y+2]:=col[x,y];tab[x,y+2]:=27;mat[x,y+2]:=9;Voice4:=2;end;
- Time bonus of -100 really seems odd.

amoeba threshold - belül %-ban tárolódik,
de az editor átállítja?

bdcff beolvasás miért hash table?
  size és hasonló szarok miatt
  de tobb értéket is kéne tárolni esetleg, a hash table ezt akadályozza

design tips?
