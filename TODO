TO DO

language button

All drawing objects should wraparound, at least when lineshifted borders are activated.

As the name of the game can be hidden in sdash, maybe you can also use the real Boulder Dash font for the status line before hatching? 

Scheduling:	different settings for clck, 1stb?

music theme at the title picture?
	
sdash bd1 intermissions scroll. maybe screen should be larger? or disable scrolling for these somehow?

extensive commenting

cow not perfect

record and playback of games

option "More than 1 bomb" in the cave settings

I think the way you implemented the Maze and RandomFill is okay. I assume the engine will expect as many seed values as there are levels, right? This is a very important detail which has to be documented in the BDCFF specs. 

copy&paste objects?
