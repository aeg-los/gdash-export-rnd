1stB, CrLi uses 4 stages for ghost explosion, clock birth, steelwall birth, bomb explosion and boulder birth each. The first is for delay state purposes and has the same graphics assigned as the 2nd stage. The 3rd and 4th are for the following frames with the other two explosion graphics. That makes those explosions last for 3 frames actually.
I noticed that GDash uses 4 different graphics for those and they also last 4 frames.
Same with the bomb, once armed, it lasts 6 frames until it explodes while it is 7 in GDash.

	Either way, though, I think that the player should always be notified they're playing an intermission from the start (even if it means not using the opening status bar at all) It's not like you need to keep track of your lives during an intermission anyway.

As there is an Amoeba 2 now, I think it would be nice to be able to set a different color for that then Amoeba 1!
