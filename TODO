- native look on windows
- In the index view if I select a cave with a "&" char in the name the status bar on the bottom shows it as "&amp;". So "Skulls & Bones" becomes "Skulls &amp; Bones". But only in the status bar, in the index window the name is correct.
- Moreover can you tell me where to change the word "Höhle" to "Höhlen" for the status bar? It should be plural.
- And another small thing: If I changed something in editor, get back to the game and want to quit the game a message appears if I want to save the changes. As I set german as language the message appears in german but the key for "Ja" (yes) is not "J" but "Y" ("N" is still "Nein" and "No" - so no difference). Shouldn't it be "J" for german systems?
- editor file open ablak; cancel, de mégis bepróbálkozik
- options ablaknál az sdl verzióban is legyen valami módon help/description az egyes opciókhoz! fine scrollinghoz beírni, hogy lehet nem lesz jobb tőle.
- Don Pedro's BD7 Cave M is set to BD1 engine, when it needs to be set to BD2. Otherwise the amoeba is affected by the magic wall bug.
- Magic wall break scan implemented so it affects amoeba. Buggy timing is not implemented, however.
- Quitting on Q from menu. escape quittingnél kérdezzen rá? maradjon meg az escape.
- rocket launcher help, rocket launcher - one rocket or infinite rockets / one rocket



TO DO
-----
opengl stuff

pixbuffactory::gimme_a_screen  ?

fire ant dash @ c64hq

- Masters Boulder Dash Cave B, the inbox timing is out rendering the cave unsolvable (firefly 
smash under both PAL and NTSC), a quick change of the hatch value from 2 to 3 for all leveels 
sorts that out.

two different particle effects for diamond: diamond fall, diamond collect

snapshot when playing

replay menünél legyen szép a lapozás (most néha címke marad alulra)

gtk version settings - install theme button

"show variables in test" stuff

gtkapp.cpp - the timing & other routines should be in the gtkmainwindow class

settings.cpp - all settings to a static class
all parameters to another static class - to know what's happening

NEW ELEMENTS
    fragile diamonds
    How about a gate that shuts after a certain amount of diamonds have been collected? Just put the gate in front of the exit and have a number somewhere that counts down the diamonds until it closes. 
    portable conveyor belts?	destructible, convey each other.
    - rockford with gun
    - option "More than 1 bomb" in the cave settings
    - telescope arm

    *) Rockford's revenge cave 9 scrolling
    itt az a kérdés, melyik legyen az active player. az, akit először/utoljára megtalál a cave scan,
    vagy az, akit először/utoljára megtalál ÉS tudott mozogni?
    a születő rockford is számítson aktívnak!

compat:
	*) frustidash
	*) magicwall breakscan; De Luxe Caves 1 Cave L, De Luxe Caves 2 Cave A ????, Deluxe Caves 3 Cave A
    *) The second issue is not so important. In bd1-games, the magicwall stops the amoeba even if the 
    amoeba is located above the magicwall. For the moment, I implemented it this way: When an 
    element passes the magicwall I set all the following amoebas to the delayed state. This causes a 
    conversion, if no amoeba was able to grow before the scan of this element. Of course, this is 
    not how it works. Ok, I have to adjust my implementation. I remarked that the conversion takes 
    place in the same scan, not in the next. So it's much easier to implement: When a stone drops 
    into the magicwall, you only have to set the variable that indicates if the amoeba is "enclosed" 
    and have to convert in this scan to "True". All the falling amoebas will be converted.
    
I do not know if this is possible at all but an adaptive frame rate corresponding with the 
monitor refresh rate would be nice but I do not know if the influence on the game speed would be 
negative.

bdcff beolvasás miért hash table?
  size és hasonló szarok miatt
  de tobb értéket is kéne tárolni esetleg, a hash table ezt akadályozza
  multimap nem oldja meg?
  c++98 multimap insert: There are no guarantees on the relative order of equivalent elements.

cave play statistics:   1   2   3   4   5
        played
        finished
        best time
        most diamonds
        most score
something missing in GDash - now you can immediately see which caves you've played, and which 
ones you should try again, also, high score, best time, most collected diamonds. delete 
highscore stuff from cave, caveset & bdcff

editor cave statistics:
    - size
    - number of Boulders
    - number of Diamonds
    - number of dirt
    - number of Fireflies

replay hogy minden keypresst elmentsen?
keypress->mov az iteratebe
de ez mire lenne jo?

Amoeba2 sound
new slime sound
replicator sound

mi legyen a replay checksumokkal

design tips?

cow movement not perfect

pal emulation should be somehow the attribute of the screen object.
