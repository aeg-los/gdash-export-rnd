fragile diamonds

How about a gate that shuts after a certain amount of diamonds have been collected? Just put the gate in front of the exit and have a number somewhere that counts down the diamonds until it closes.

portable conveyor belts?	destructible, convey each other.

new elements sound

Amoeba2 sound
new slime sound
replicator sound

theme image glob pattern

amikor bezárja az editor ablakot, akkor kéne egy replay checksum update?
vagy a delete event, és akkor rákérdez

STATUS BAR
	As for the status bar in GDash: Maybe a little bit larger font would do the thing. There is enough space to use a larger font.

Maybe game notes can be displayed under the title screen as soon as the game is loaded. Optionally at least if someone does not like to show it automatically.

Already suggested I think: Atari sounds.


amoeba threshold - belül %-ban tárolódik,
de az editor átállítja?

bdcff beolvasás miért hash table?
  size és hasonló szarok miatt
  de tobb értéket is kéne tárolni esetleg, a hash table ezt akadályozza

design tips?
