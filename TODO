c64 grafika tomb meretet ellenorizni, legalabb a szorzat meglegyen

I really like the new scrolling function, but at cave start a problem can appear. If the game is paused with the screen on the opposite side of the cave as the "start", Rockford will hatch offscreen before the scrolling catches up to him. Allowing a fast scroll at cave start - until hatch would fix it.


new elements sound

Amoeba2 sound
new slime sound
replicator sound

amikor bezárja az editor ablakot, akkor kéne egy replay checksum update?
vagy a delete event, és akkor rákérdez

TITLE SCREEN
	Animated intro screen would be nice. It's not necessary to see a complete game or so but animated walls, diamonds, butterflies, etc. would be nice. Same as in the original C64 games.
	Maybe animate the intro screen? It might be cool to have a little background cave where the elements move around. Or something.

STATUS BAR
	As for the status bar in GDash: Maybe a little bit larger font would do the thing. There is enough space to use a larger font.

Maybe game notes can be displayed under the title screen as soon as the game is loaded. Optionally at least if someone does not like to show it automatically. 

Maybe a button to apply certain settings to all caves. We'd have to think of which may be appropriate. Timing maybe. Or color palette type. Dunno about this one.

Already suggested I think: Atari sounds.

copy&paste elengedés után movera vált,

brc slime permeability
if (random(slime*4)<4) and (tab[x,y+2]=0) then
      Begin tab[x,y]:=0;col[x,y+2]:=col[x,y];tab[x,y+2]:=27;mat[x,y+2]:=9;Voice4:=2;end;
- Time bonus of -100 really seems odd.

amoeba threshold - belül %-ban tárolódik,
de az editor átállítja?

gtk verzióba		{TypeBoolean, N_("Even lines vertical scroll"), N_("Even lines vertical scroll"), &gd_even_line_pal_emu_vertical_scroll, FALSE},

bdcff beolvasás miért hash table?
  size és hasonló szarok miatt
  de tobb értéket is kéne tárolni esetleg, a hash table ezt akadályozza

design tips?

cow not perfect

option "More than 1 bomb" in the cave settings

compat:
