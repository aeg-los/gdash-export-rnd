/**
 * The App object manages Activity objects by organizing them in a stack,
 * and always sending timer and user events to the topmost one.
 *
 * The App object is responsible for the activity objects. New activities
 * are can be pushed into it, thus they become the topmost one. The
 * activities should be dynamically allocated, and the App will delete
 * them when they are no longer needed (they are popped from the stack).
 *
 * The normal use of the App class is creating an App object and pushing
 * the first activity onto its stack. This first activity is then receiving
 * the events, and is also allowed to create new activities. All timer,
 * keyboard and redraw events which are received by the owner of the app
 * object by some operating system or graphics library dependent way, must
 * be forwarded to the App using one of its event() methods. The app will
 * then send it to the topmost activity. The app also generates special
 * events for the activities when it manages them; for example, when an
 * activity becomes the topmost one or it is occluded by a new one, it is
 * notified.
 *
 * The activities are enabled to create Command objects and enqueue them
 * in the app. The app will execute these commands after any kind of event.
 *
 * In order to make an App object work, it must be assigned many helper
 * objects which do the OS and graphics library abstraction. These objects
 * are a Screen, a GameInputHandler, a FontManager and a PixbufFactory. The
 * activities inside the application are allowed - and required - to use
 * these objects to do their work.
 *
 * The App object also provides simple drawing methods not implemented anywhere
 * else, like clearing the screen, setting the color of the next text written,
 * or drawing a status line.
 * @todo Move the drawing commands in the App class to the Screen class?
 *
 * The App object can tell its owner when the last activity exited (and
 * therefore the app became defunct) or when one of the activities requested
 * a complete restart of the application. This is implemented using Command
 * objects, which can be assigned to such events.
 *
 * The App object provides functions for common tasks like selecting a file
 * or showing a piece of text. By default, these functions create the corresponding
 * activity. However, derived classes of the App class are allowed to override
 * these functions to specialize the user interface: for example, a GTK+
 * specialization can provide the builtin file selection dialog of GTK+ instead of
 * the one implemented by the SelectFileActivity class.
