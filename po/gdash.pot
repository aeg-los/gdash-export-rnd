#. TRANSLATORS: some languages (for example, german) do not have lowercase nouns.
#. When gdash generates the list of lowercase element names, this has to be
#. taken into account. Therefore we have a string, which must be changed
#. by the translator to select the behavior.
#. For example, the name of the element is "Brick wall", as in a button, it has to be
#. written with an uppercase initial. But if "Line of brick wall", the B is changed to b.
#. However, this is not allowed in some languages, for example, German.
#. So one writes "Ziegelmauer", and "Linie aus Ziegelmauer", the Z is not changed to z.
#. Set the translated string to "lowercase-element-names-yes", if your language
#. allows writing nouns with lowercase initials. Set it to "lowercase-element-names-no",
#. if not: for example, german. Do not translate the string, but set the behavior!
